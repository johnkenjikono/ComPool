# üèÜ ComPool - Pool Money and Compete!

ComPool is a mobile and web application that allows users to create and manage pooled money groups with friends.

---

## üìÇ Project Overview
- This the final Project
- Web/Mobile frontend and backend are built from previous HWs, located in the same repo.
- Mobile app files (my-app)
- Web Development files (HW1)
---

## üì± Running Tests (Problem 1)
Open terminal and cd into ComPool then:
```
cd HW1
```
```
cd test-project
```
run:
```
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests
```
To run individual tests these are the following commands for each test respectively:
```
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/TestGet_UserListTest.php
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/TestPost_CreateUserTest.php
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/TestPost_FailedLoginTest.php
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/TestPost_LoginUserTest.php
```

## üöÄ Setting Up the Project (Mobile)

### üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Make sure the following tools are installed:
- **XAMPP** (for running PHP and MySQL)
- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **Expo**
- **Android Studio** (for emulator) or a physical Android/iOS device

---

### üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup (database small changes from HW2)

#### üìÅ Database Creation in phpMyAdmin
- Start **XAMPP**, ensure **Apache** and **MySQL** are running
- Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`

#### üõ† Create Database and Tables
```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `app-db`;
USE `app-db`;

-- Create the users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    username VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 1000.00
);

-- Create the groups table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS groups (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    group_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    group_size INT NOT NULL CHECK (group_size > 0),
    members TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    funds DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

```


#### üß© Backend code:
The folder RestAPI has all files for the backend code

#### üìÅ Place REST API in HTDOCS

1. Locate the `RestAPI/` folder in this repository.

2. Copy the **entire contents** of the `RestAPI/` folder into your `htdocs/` folder inside your local XAMPP directory.

```
C:/xampp/htdocs/
```

the file: `inc/config.php`, has your connection to the database locally. Change it accordingly.
You can create the file and copy and paste this in. (This is not in the git ignore since we copied a safe version of our rest API into the repo)
```
<?php
define("DB_HOST", "localhost");
define("DB_USERNAME", "root");
define("DB_PASSWORD", "");
define("DB_DATABASE_NAME", "app-db");
```
The final structure should look like:

```
htdocs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Controller/Api/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BaseController.php
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatController.php
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GroupController.php
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UserController.php

‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ Model/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatModel.php
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database.php
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GroupModel.php
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UserModel.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inc/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bootstrap.php
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  config.php
```

inc/config.php has your connection to the database locally make sure you changed it accordingly

## üîÅ REST API Connection to our code

‚úÖ **Create a new file `my-app/config.js` in the project with your real IP address to connect to the database.**
Copy and paste this into the new file (Our file is in the gitignore since it holds sensitive info)
```
// config.js
export const BASE_URL = 'http://yourIPaddress/index.php';
export const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-*****...'
```
**The helpdesk feature will only work if you have a paid OpenAI API account.**

## üì± Running the Mobile App
Open Andorid studio and Open our project Compool wherever you downloaded it
Start your android device

Open terminal and
cd into my-app from Compool
```
cd my-app
```
run:
```
npm install
npm run android
```

And you should see Compool running on your virtual device!
