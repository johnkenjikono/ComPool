# 🏆 ComPool - Pool Money and Compete!

ComPool is a mobile and web application that allows users to create and manage pooled money groups with friends.

---

## 📂 Project Overview
- This project is **HW #3** (mobile frontend connected to the backend).
- Web frontend and backend are continued from **HW #2**, located in the same repo.

---

## 🚀 Setting Up the Project

### 🔹 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Make sure the following tools are installed:
- **XAMPP** (for running PHP and MySQL)
- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **Expo**
- **Android Studio** (for emulator) or a physical Android/iOS device

---

### 🔹 2️⃣ Backend Setup (database same as HW2)

#### 📁 Database Creation in phpMyAdmin
- Start **XAMPP**, ensure **Apache** and **MySQL** are running
- Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`

#### 🛠 Create Database and Tables
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `app-db`;
USE `app-db`;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    username VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS groups (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    group_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    group_size INT NOT NULL CHECK (group_size > 0),
    members TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```


#### 🧩 Backend code:
The folder RestAPI has all files for the backend code

#### 📁 Place REST API in HTDOCS

1. Locate the `RestAPI/` folder in this repository.

2. Copy the **entire contents** of the `RestAPI/` folder into your `htdocs/` folder inside your local XAMPP directory.

```
C:/xampp/htdocs/
```

The final structure should look like:

```
htdocs/
├── Controller/Api/
│   ├── BaseController.php
│   └── GroupController.php
│   └── UserController.php
│── Model/
│   ├── Database.php
│   ├── GroupModel.php
│   └── UserModel.php
├── index.php
├── inc/
│   ├── bootstrap.php
│   └──  config.php
```

inc/config.php has your connection to the database locally change it accordingly
```
<?php
define("DB_HOST", "localhost");
define("DB_USERNAME", "root");
define("DB_PASSWORD", "");
define("DB_DATABASE_NAME", "app-db");
```

## 🔁 REST API Overview

All backend endpoints are available locally via:
```
http://<YOUR-IP>/index.php/
```

✅ **Update `config.js` in the project to your real IP address.**
```
// config.js
export const BASE_URL = 'http://yourIPaddress/index.php';
```
