                <p class="team-description">First through the breach is Cory Reavy, a striking young savant from Mamaroneck, New York. He enjoys sailing, rowing, and occasionally constructing a website. Once, after not getting remunerated for a fantasy football win, he wondered, "Is there a better way to do this?" And thus, ComPool was born.</p>

                <p class="team-description">Kenji Kono also grew up in Mamaroneck, New York. He often found himself longing for a purpose in life and drifted aimlessly. When he heard about the ComPool idea, he was thrilled to get his foot in the door at the highest-potential newly made HTML site in all of Middletown. Management congratulates Kenji on his promotion.</p>
