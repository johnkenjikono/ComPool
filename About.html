                <p class="team-description">Kenji Kono also grew up in Mamaroneck New York. He often found he longed for a purpose in life, and often drifted aimlessly. When he heard about the ComPool idea, he was thrilled to get his foot in the door at the highest-potential newly made html site in all of Middletown. Management congratulates Kenji on his promotion to Senior Intern.</p>
